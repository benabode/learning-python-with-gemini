# learning-python-with-gemini
This is just a playground for me to learn python with self-prompted lectures and exercises with Google Gemini. The purpose is to learn python, git and start my programming journey.

I use Google Gemini to prompt python lectures and task that help me start coding again with python, create projects and more. The main goal for now as of writing is to gain a fundamental understanding of Python, then later on expand it together with OBS Websocket to write scripts for recording purposes.

Example of prompts that I wrote to generate lectures:
"Generate lectures to learn Python. These lectures whould have both written examples, explanations and tasks regarding python and increase in difficulty from a beginner point of view. The goal is to reach a fundamental understanding of Python and usecases, which should be expanded upon further on. Start by generating the first lecture and await my code reply for review and feedback purposes before generating the next lecture.
